## 🔎 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineer and PhD student focused on **signal processing** and **machine learning** for neural and physiological data. I build **real‑time, interpretable learning systems** (GPU‑accelerated) and lead community workshops that make advanced topics approachable for newcomers and useful for experts.

* President & co‑founder, **IEEE Signal Processing Society @ UF**
* Researcher, **Computational NeuroEngineering Lab (CNEL), University of Florida**
* Interests: **state‑space models**, **online/streaming learning**, **information‑theoretic objectives**, **assistive neurotechnology**

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

* **SPS Curriculum** – Standardized, hands‑on workshops for signal processing & ML at UF (2024–2025).
* **Zebrafish Voltage‑Imaging & Neuromechanics Analysis** – Open analysis tools for 2D voltage imaging and behavior alignment.
* **Plato’s Cave** – A human‑centered, agentic system for validating research papers (contributor).
* **DinoDetect** – Discord analytics + simple NLP/LLM‑assisted workflows for community moderation & insights.

> I care about **robustness, latency, and interpretability**: if a method is fast and reliable, we can use it in the loop with humans.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

**Languages**: Python, C/C++, (some) Assembly, TypeScript
**Compute**: CUDA, CuPy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, Numba
**DSP/ML**: Signal processing pipelines, state‑space models, Kalman filters, online learning
**Data/Apps**: Jupyter, FastAPI, Next.js/React, Discord API, OpenAI API
**Workflow**: Git, GitHub Actions, Conda, VS Code

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

If you’re building **assistive neurotech**, **robust DSP/ML**, or **open education** resources, I’m happy to chat. Best way to reach me is by email or LinkedIn.

## ⚡ Fun

When I’m not coding, I **DJ and produce** electronic music (dance, trance, techno) and run hands‑on workshops for the UF community.
